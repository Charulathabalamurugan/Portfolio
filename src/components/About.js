      <p>
        I'm a budding programmer and passionate web designer, eager to learn and
        collaborate. I absorb new skills quickly, focusing on web development
        and problem-solving. Currently enrolled in Spotknack's Front-End
        Program, I thrive in this dynamic community, building bridges and
        shaping the digital future.
